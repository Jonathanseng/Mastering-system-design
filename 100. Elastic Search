ElasticSearch is a free and open, search and analytics engine for different types of data (textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured data).
Raw data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources that use Beats.
This data is parsed, normalized, enriched using Logstash, and
finally indexed in Elasticsearch.


1. run complex queries against their data 

2. retrieve complex summaries of their data 

3. createvisualizations

How elastic search work?

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source search and analytics engine that enables fast and efficient searching, indexing, and analysis of large volumes of data. Here is an overview of how Elasticsearch works:

Data Indexing: Elasticsearch stores data in a distributed index, which is divided into smaller pieces called shards. When data is indexed, it is split into smaller chunks and distributed across multiple nodes in the Elasticsearch cluster. Each shard is then indexed and optimized for faster search and retrieval.

Query Execution: When a user searches for data, Elasticsearch queries all the shards in parallel and returns the results in a matter of milliseconds. Elasticsearch uses a query DSL (Domain Specific Language) to specify the search criteria, and it supports a wide range of search queries and filters.

Data Analysis: Elasticsearch also provides powerful data analysis capabilities through its aggregation framework. Users can define aggregation queries to group and summarize data, calculate metrics, and generate reports.

Cluster Management: Elasticsearch is designed to run as a distributed system across multiple nodes, providing high availability and fault tolerance. It uses a master-slave architecture, where one or more nodes act as master nodes and coordinate the cluster operations, while the rest act as data nodes that store and search the data.

Data Security: Elasticsearch provides several security features, including role-based access control, SSL/TLS encryption, and auditing capabilities. These features help to secure sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

Overall, Elasticsearch is a powerful and flexible search and analytics engine that can handle a wide range of data processing tasks. Its ability to scale horizontally makes it ideal for large-scale data processing applications, such as log analysis, e-commerce search, and enterprise search.
Elastic search and its application

Elasticsearch is a highly versatile search and analytics engine that can be used in a wide range of applications. Here are some of the most common applications of Elasticsearch:

Enterprise Search: Elasticsearch can be used as an enterprise search solution to provide employees with a fast and efficient search experience across various data sources. It can index and search data from various repositories such as databases, file systems, and other enterprise applications.

E-commerce Search: Elasticsearch can be used in e-commerce applications to provide customers with a fast and accurate search experience. It can handle complex queries and provide relevant search results, making it ideal for online retailers with large catalogs of products.

Log Analysis: Elasticsearch can be used for log analysis to index, search, and analyze log data generated by servers, applications, and other systems. It can help to identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and provide insights into system performance.

Business Intelligence: Elasticsearch can be used in business intelligence applications to provide users with insights into data trends and patterns. It can perform real-time aggregations, filtering, and sorting of data to generate reports and dashboards.

Security and Compliance: Elasticsearch can be used to store and search security logs, making it ideal for security and compliance applications. It provides a secure and scalable platform for storing and analyzing large volumes of security data.

Geospatial Search: Elasticsearch has built-in support for geospatial data, making it ideal for location-based search applications. It can handle complex geospatial queries and provide relevant search results based on location.

Overall, Elasticsearch is a highly versatile search and analytics engine that can be used in a wide range of applications. Its ability to scale horizontally and handle complex queries makes it ideal for large-scale data processing applications in enterprise, e-commerce, and other domains.
