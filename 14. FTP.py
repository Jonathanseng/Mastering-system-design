# Python code for connecting to an FTP server, downloading a file, and uploading a file using the built-in ftplib module:

import ftplib

# Set up connection parameters
ftp = ftplib.FTP("ftp.example.com")
ftp.login("username", "password")

# Download a file from the server
with open("file.txt", "wb") as f:
    ftp.retrbinary("RETR file.txt", f.write)

# Upload a file to the server
with open("file.txt", "rb") as f:
    ftp.storbinary("STOR file.txt", f)

# Close the FTP connection
ftp.quit()

# In this example, we first connect to an FTP server using the FTP function and the server address, username, and password.

# Then, we download a file named "file.txt" from the server using the retrbinary method, which retrieves a file in binary mode and writes it to a local file. Similarly, we upload a file named "file.txt" to the server using the storbinary method, which stores a file in binary mode on the server.

# Finally, we close the FTP connection using the quit method.
