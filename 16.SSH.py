# To connect to a remote server using SSH in Python, you can use the paramiko library. Here is an example code snippet that shows how to establish an SSH connection and execute a command on a remote server:
import paramiko

# Establish SSH connection
ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh.connect(hostname='remote.server.com', username='username', password='password')

# Execute command on remote server
stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('ls -l')
for line in stdout:
    print(line.strip())

# Close SSH connection
ssh.close()


# In this code, we first import the paramiko library, which provides an SSH client implementation in Python. We then establish an SSH connection to a remote server by specifying the server hostname, username, and password.

# Once the connection is established, we can execute a command on the remote server using the exec_command method of the SSHClient object. In this example, we execute the ls -l command, which lists the files in the current directory on the remote server.

# Finally, we close the SSH connection using the close method of the SSHClient object.
