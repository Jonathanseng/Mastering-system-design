Latency is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another. In the context of computing, latency refers to the time it takes for a request to be processed by a server. Latency can be caused by a number of factors, including the distance between the client and the server, the load on the server, and the type of network connection.

Here is an example of how latency can affect a user experience:

* A user is playing a video game online. The user's computer sends a request to the game server to update the game state. The server receives the request and updates the game state. The server then sends a response back to the user's computer. The total time it takes for the request to be sent, the server to process it, and the response to be sent back is the latency.

If the latency is high, the user will experience lag in the game. This is because the user's computer is waiting for the server to respond before it can continue playing the game.

Here is an example of how to measure latency in Python:

```python
import time

def measure_latency(url):
  start = time.time()
  response = requests.get(url)
  end = time.time()

  return end - start

latency = measure_latency('https://www.google.com')

print(latency)
```

This code will measure the latency of a request to the Google website. The output of the code will be the time it took for the request to be processed by the server.

There are a number of things that can be done to improve latency, including:

* Using a closer server
* Using a faster network connection
* Using a more efficient programming language

By reducing latency, you can improve the user experience of your applications.
