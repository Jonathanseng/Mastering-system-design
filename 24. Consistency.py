# In Python, there are various ways to implement consistency in code. Here's an example of a function that checks whether a list of numbers is consistent, meaning that all the numbers are equal:

def is_consistent(numbers):
    """
    Returns True if all the numbers in the list are consistent,
    meaning that they are equal. Returns False otherwise.
    """
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return True # an empty list is considered consistent
    else:
        first_number = numbers[0]
        for number in numbers:
            if number != first_number:
                return False # if any number is different from the first one, the list is not consistent
        return True # if all numbers are equal, the list is consistent

  # Here's how you can use this function to check the consistency of a list of numbers:
  >>> numbers1 = [1, 1, 1, 1]
>>> is_consistent(numbers1)
True

>>> numbers2 = [1, 2, 1, 1]
>>> is_consistent(numbers2)
False

# Of course, consistency can also apply to other aspects of programming, such as naming conventions, coding styles, formatting, error handling, and documentation. By following consistent practices in these areas, you can make your code more readable, maintainable, and scalable.
