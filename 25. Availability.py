It's not possible to provide a single Python code for availability, as it is not something that can be implemented in a single script or program. Availability is a characteristic of a system, application, or service that reflects its ability to remain operational and accessible to users over time. Achieving high availability requires a combination of design choices, system architecture, infrastructure, monitoring and alerting, and disaster recovery planning.

However, there are various Python libraries and frameworks that can help in achieving high availability for your application. Some of the popular ones are:

Flask: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that can be used to build highly available web applications. It has built-in support for load balancing and can be deployed to various cloud platforms.

Django: Django is a popular Python web framework that provides robust support for high availability through its database layer and caching framework.

Celery: Celery is a distributed task queue that can be used to offload processing to multiple workers, improving availability and scalability.

Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that can help manage and scale your application, ensuring high availability and resilience.

Nagios: Nagios is a popular monitoring tool that can be used to monitor the availability of your application and send alerts if any issues are detected.

These tools can help in achieving high availability for your application, but it's important to keep in mind that availability is a holistic concept that requires careful planning and design choices.
