# It's difficult to provide a specific example of redundancy in Python because the implementation will depend on the specific context and application. However, here's an example of how you might use redundancy to implement a simple backup system:

import shutil
import os
import time

# Define the primary and backup directories
primary_dir = "/path/to/primary/directory"
backup_dir = "/path/to/backup/directory"

# Define a function to copy files from the primary directory to the backup directory
def backup_files():
    shutil.copytree(primary_dir, backup_dir)

# Use redundancy to periodically back up files from the primary directory to the backup directory
while True:
    try:
        backup_files()
        print("Files backed up successfully.")
        time.sleep(3600)  # Backup once per hour
    except:
        print("Backup failed. Switching to backup directory.")
        primary_dir = backup_dir  # Switch to using the backup directory as the primary directory
        time.sleep(60)  # Wait for one minute before trying again
# In this example, the script periodically backs up files from the primary directory to the backup directory using the backup_files() function. If the backup process fails, the script switches to using the backup directory as the primary directory and waits for one minute before trying again.

# Note that this is just a simple example of how redundancy can be implemented in Python, and there are many other ways to use redundancy depending on the specific context and requirements of the system or application.
