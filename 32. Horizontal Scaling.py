# It's difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all Python code for horizontal scaling, as it depends heavily on the specific application and architecture of the system. However, I can provide a general example of how a load balancer might be implemented using Python:

import http.server
import socketserver

# Set up a simple HTTP server
PORT = 8000
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
httpd = socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)

# Define a list of backend servers to load balance to
backend_servers = ['backend1.example.com', 'backend2.example.com', 'backend3.example.com']

# Set up a load balancer to distribute requests across backend servers
class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, servers):
        self.servers = servers
        self.current = 0

    def next_server(self):
        server = self.servers[self.current]
        self.current = (self.current + 1) % len(self.servers)
        return server

load_balancer = LoadBalancer(backend_servers)

# Override the HTTP handler's do_GET method to forward requests to backend servers
class LoadBalancingHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        # Get the next available backend server from the load balancer
        backend_server = load_balancer.next_server()
        
        # Forward the request to the backend server
        self.proxy_request(backend_server)

    def proxy_request(self, backend_server):
        # Set up a new HTTP connection to the backend server
        conn = http.client.HTTPConnection(backend_server)
        
        # Forward the original request to the backend server
        conn.request(self.command, self.path, self.headers)
        response = conn.getresponse()

        # Forward the backend server's response back to the client
        self.send_response(response.status)
        for header, value in response.getheaders():
            self.send_header(header, value)
        self.end_headers()
        self.copyfile(response, self.wfile)
        conn.close()

# Start the HTTP server with the load balancing handler
httpd.RequestHandlerClass = LoadBalancingHandler
print(f"Serving on port {PORT}")
httpd.serve_forever()

# In this example, we start a simple HTTP server and define a list of backend servers to load balance to. We then define a load balancer that distributes requests across the backend servers in a round-robin fashion. Finally, we override the do_GET method of the HTTP handler to forward requests to the load balancer, which in turn forwards the requests to the appropriate backend server. Note that this is a simplified example and does not take into account many of the complexities involved in implementing a load balancer in a real-world system.
