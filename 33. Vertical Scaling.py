Vertical scaling involves upgrading the hardware components of a server or machine to increase its capacity and performance. Therefore, it is not something that can be achieved through Python code alone. Instead, it requires physical upgrades to the server hardware, such as adding more RAM, upgrading the CPU, or increasing storage capacity.

That being said, Python can be used to automate the process of upgrading server hardware by running scripts to install and configure new hardware components. For example, you can use Python to automate the installation of new RAM modules or to configure the operating system to allocate more resources to a particular application.

Here's an example Python script that shows how to install a new package using the apt package manager on a Debian-based Linux system:

import subprocess

# install the htop package using the apt package manager
subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt', 'update'])
subprocess.run(['sudo', 'apt', 'install', 'htop'])


# In this example, the subprocess module is used to run the apt package manager with the update and install commands to install the htop package. This package can be used to monitor system performance and resource usage, which can be helpful when upgrading server hardware.

#While Python can be used to automate the process of upgrading server hardware to some extent, it is important to note that physical upgrades to the server hardware require careful planning and execution. Therefore, it is recommended to consult with a qualified professional before attempting to upgrade server hardware.
