It is a collection of data organized into a non-tabular form.
The structure of the storage model is flexible and is optimized for the type of data to be stored.
These usually do not support the use of SQL and are also called No-SQL databases.
For example, Firebase and MongoDB.

How No Sql work?

NoSQL databases work in a fundamentally different way than traditional relational databases. While relational databases store data in tables with a fixed schema, NoSQL databases use a variety of different data models to store and retrieve data. Here are some key characteristics of how NoSQL databases work:

Flexible Schema: NoSQL databases allow for flexible schemas, meaning that data can be stored in a variety of different formats without needing to define a fixed schema in advance. This allows for easier handling of unstructured and semi-structured data.

Distributed Architecture: NoSQL databases are often designed to be distributed across multiple servers or nodes, which allows for horizontal scaling and improved performance. Data is typically partitioned across multiple nodes using a sharding or partitioning strategy.

High Availability: NoSQL databases are often designed to be highly available, meaning that they are always up and running and able to serve requests. This is achieved through the use of techniques such as replication, fault tolerance, and automatic failover.

Data Models: NoSQL databases use a variety of different data models to store and retrieve data, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph. Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of data model will depend on the specific requirements of the application.

APIs: NoSQL databases often provide APIs that allow developers to interact with the database using a variety of programming languages and protocols, including RESTful APIs, drivers for popular programming languages like Python and Java, and specialized query languages like GraphQL.

Overall, NoSQL databases are designed to be flexible, scalable, and highly available, allowing for efficient management of large volumes of data. However, they can also introduce new challenges around consistency, transaction support, and data modeling, so it's important to carefully consider the requirements of your application before choosing a NoSQL database.
No sql and its application

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a type of database management system that is designed to store and manage data in a non-relational way. NoSQL databases can handle large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making them ideal for use cases where traditional relational databases may not be a good fit. Here are some common applications of NoSQL databases:

Big Data Analytics: NoSQL databases are often used to store and analyze large volumes of data generated by social media, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and other sources. These databases can handle both structured and unstructured data and provide fast access to data for real-time analysis and reporting.

Content Management Systems: NoSQL databases are used to store and manage content in web applications, such as blogs, forums, and e-commerce sites. These databases can store large volumes of content and allow for fast retrieval and indexing of data.

Mobile and Web Applications: NoSQL databases are often used in mobile and web applications, where speed and scalability are important. These databases can handle large volumes of data and provide fast access to data for real-time interactions and user experiences.

Graph Databases: NoSQL databases are used to store and manage graph data, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems. These databases can store and traverse complex relationships between data points and provide fast access to data for real-time analysis and reporting.

Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, Couchbase, and Neo4j. NoSQL databases are a powerful tool for managing and analyzing large volumes of data in a flexible and scalable way. However, they can also introduce new challenges around data consistency, transaction support, and schema management, so it's important to carefully consider the requirements of your application before choosing a NoSQL database.
