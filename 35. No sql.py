# To work with NoSQL databases in Python, you first need to install a NoSQL database and a Python driver for that database. Here's an example of how to work with MongoDB, one of the most popular NoSQL databases, using the PyMongo driver:

import pymongo

# connect to MongoDB
client = pymongo.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')

# create a database and collection
mydb = client['mydatabase']
mycol = mydb['customers']

# insert a document
mydict = { "name": "John", "address": "Highway 37" }
x = mycol.insert_one(mydict)

# print the inserted document ID
print(x.inserted_id)

# find a document
query = { "name": "John" }
result = mycol.find_one(query)
print(result)

# In this example, we first connect to MongoDB using the PyMongo driver and create a database called "mydatabase" and a collection called "customers". We then insert a document into the collection using the insert_one() method, and print the ID of the inserted document.

#Finally, we use the find_one() method to retrieve a document from the collection that matches a given query. This method returns the first document that matches the query, or None if no documents match the query.

#This is just a simple example, and there are many more advanced features and capabilities of NoSQL databases that you can work with using Python. The PyMongo documentation provides a comprehensive guide to working with MongoDB in Python, including examples of advanced querying, indexing, and aggregation operations.
