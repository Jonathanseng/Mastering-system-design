# Here is an example of how to use a database transaction in Python using the built-in sqlite3 module:

import sqlite3

# Connect to database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Begin transaction
cursor.execute("BEGIN")

try:
    # Execute database operations
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)", ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com'))
    cursor.execute("UPDATE customers SET email = ? WHERE name = ?", ('janedoe@example.com', 'Jane Doe'))

    # Commit transaction
    conn.commit()
    print("Transaction committed")

except Exception as e:
    # Rollback transaction if an error occurs
    conn.rollback()
    print("Transaction rolled back")

finally:
    # Close database connection
    conn.close()
# In this example, we begin a transaction using the BEGIN statement, then execute some database operations (an INSERT and an UPDATE statement) within the transaction. If no errors occur, we commit the transaction using the commit() method. If an error occurs, we rollback the transaction using the rollback() method to undo any changes made during the transaction. Finally, we close the database connection using the close() method.

# Note that the specific database operations (i.e. the INSERT and UPDATE statements in this example) will depend on your specific use case and the structure of your database.
