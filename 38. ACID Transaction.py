# ACID is a concept that applies to database transactions and not something that can be directly implemented in Python code. However, many database management systems provide ACID-compliant transactions as a core feature. In Python, you can interact with a database system using a database API, such as the Python DB-API, which provides a standard interface for Python programs to access and interact with different databases.

# Here is an example of using the Python DB-API to perform a transaction on a SQLite database:

import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Start a transaction
conn.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION')

try:
    # Execute some database operations
    conn.execute('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)', ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com'))
    conn.execute('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE id = ?', (100.0, 1))
    conn.execute('UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE id = ?', (100.0, 2))

    # Commit the transaction
    conn.commit()
except:
    # Rollback the transaction if an exception occurs
    conn.rollback()

# Close the connection
conn.close()

# In this example, we first connect to a SQLite database using the sqlite3 module. We then start a transaction using the BEGIN TRANSACTION SQL statement. Within the transaction, we execute several database operations, including inserting a new user, and updating the balances of two accounts. Finally, we commit the transaction if all of the operations succeed, or rollback the transaction if an exception occurs.

# By using transactions in this way, we can ensure that our database operations are executed in a way that maintains consistency and reliability, even in the face of failures or concurrent access.
