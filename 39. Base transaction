These are the transactions within a DBMS (BASE compliant) that ensure the following properties:

1. Basic Availability: Database availability is ensured by spreading and replicating it across different database cluster nodes

2. Soft State: The database does not have to offer immediate consistency

3. Eventual Consistency: The database offers consistency at a later point in time
No SQL database like Cassandra, MongoDB, and Redis are usually BASE compliant.

The ACID transaction model provides consistency.
The BASE transaction model provides high availability.
