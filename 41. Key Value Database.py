# There are many key-value database systems available for use in Python, each with their own APIs and syntax. Here's an example using the built-in dict data type in Python, which can be used as a simple key-value store:

# Define a dictionary to store key-value pairs
db = {}

# Insert a key-value pair
db['key'] = 'value'

# Retrieve a value by key
value = db.get('key')

# Update a value
db['key'] = 'new value'

# Delete a key-value pair
del db['key']

# This code defines a Python dictionary called db that can be used to store key-value pairs. Key-value pairs can be inserted into the dictionary using square bracket notation, and values can be retrieved using the get() method. The dictionary can be updated or deleted using standard Python syntax.

# Of course, this is a very basic example, and for more advanced use cases you may want to consider using a dedicated key-value database system like Redis, Riak, or Cassandra. These systems provide more advanced features like distributed data storage, automatic failover, and high scalability.
