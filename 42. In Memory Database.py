# There are several in-memory databases available for Python, such as Redis and Memcached. Here is an example of using the built-in dict data type in Python as a simple in-memory database:

# Initialize an empty dictionary to act as the in-memory database
database = {}

# Insert a key-value pair into the database
database['key'] = 'value'

# Retrieve a value from the database by key
value = database.get('key')

# Update a value in the database
database['key'] = 'new value'

# Delete a key-value pair from the database
del database['key']

# This code initializes a Python dictionary called database, which can be used to store key-value pairs in memory. Key-value pairs can be inserted into the dictionary using square bracket notation, and values can be retrieved using the get() method. The dictionary can be updated or deleted using standard Python syntax.

#Note that this is a very basic example and is not intended for production use. In real-world applications, you would typically use a dedicated in-memory database system like Redis or Memcached, which provide more advanced features such as data persistence, data expiration, and distributed caching.
