# The CAP theorem is a theoretical concept that is typically discussed in the context of system design and architecture. As such, there is no Python code that specifically implements the CAP theorem. However, you can write Python code that demonstrates the concepts behind the CAP theorem, such as the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

# Here is an example Python code that demonstrates the trade-off between consistency and availability:
import random
import time

data = {}

def read_data(key):
    if random.random() < 0.5:
        # Simulate network partition by delaying response
        time.sleep(2)
    return data.get(key)

def write_data(key, value):
    if random.random() < 0.5:
        # Simulate network partition by delaying response
        time.sleep(2)
    data[key] = value

# Simulate a workload that requires high consistency
for i in range(10):
    value = read_data('my_key')
    if value is None:
        write_data('my_key', 'my_value')
    else:
        print(value)

# Simulate a workload that requires high availability
for i in range(10):
    try:
        write_data('my_key', 'my_value')
    except:
        pass
    value = read_data('my_key')
    print(value)


# In this code, we have a simple key-value store implemented using a Python dictionary. The read_data and write_data functions simulate network partitions by occasionally delaying their responses. We then have two different workloads: one that requires high consistency (reading data and writing it back if it is missing), and one that requires high availability (writing data and then immediately reading it back). By running this code multiple times, you can see how the trade-off between consistency and availability can affect the behavior of the system.
