# Monolithic architecture is not a specific technology or tool, but rather a software architecture style. As such, there is no specific Python code for implementing a monolithic architecture.

#However, here is an example of a simple Python Flask application that demonstrates a basic monolithic architecture:

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'This is a monolithic Flask application.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

# In this example, the Flask application is a single codebase that includes all the application logic and components. The application has two routes: / and /about. When the user visits /, the application returns a "Hello, World!" message. When the user visits /about, the application returns a message that indicates that it is a monolithic Flask application.

#This example is a very basic demonstration of a monolithic architecture, but it shows how a monolithic application can be built using a single codebase and a single framework.
