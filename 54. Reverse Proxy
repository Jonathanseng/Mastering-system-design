A server that acts as an intermediary between a server and client and helps the server with the following:

1. Improves serverâ€™s security
2. Load balancing
3. Caching responses to common requests to the server !"
4. Log management


How it work

A reverse proxy is a server that acts as an intermediary for client requests to one or more servers. When a client sends a request to access a resource, such as a web page or an application, the request is first sent to the reverse proxy, which then forwards the request to the appropriate server on behalf of the client.

Here's how a typical reverse proxy works:

Client sends a request to access a resource, such as a web page or an application, to the reverse proxy server.
The reverse proxy receives the request and examines it to determine which server should handle the request.
The reverse proxy forwards the request to the appropriate server and waits for a response.
The server processes the request and sends a response back to the reverse proxy.
The reverse proxy receives the response and examines it to ensure that it is valid.
If the response is valid, the reverse proxy forwards it to the client.
In addition to forwarding requests, a reverse proxy can also perform other functions such as load balancing, SSL/TLS encryption, and caching. Here are some common use cases for reverse proxies:

Load balancing: A reverse proxy can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overloaded. This can help improve the performance and availability of web applications.

Security: A reverse proxy can act as a barrier between the internet and the internal network of an organization. This can help protect against common security threats, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, by filtering traffic and blocking malicious requests.

Caching: A reverse proxy can cache frequently accessed resources, such as web pages and images, to reduce the load on backend servers and improve the performance of web applications.

SSL/TLS encryption: A reverse proxy can terminate SSL/TLS connections from clients and then establish new connections with backend servers. This can help improve security by encrypting traffic between clients and servers.

Overall, reverse proxies are an essential component of many web applications and can help improve performance, security, and scalability.
its application

Reverse proxies are widely used in many different applications and scenarios. Here are some common use cases for reverse proxies:

Load balancing: Reverse proxies can distribute incoming requests across multiple servers, balancing the load on the servers and improving the performance and availability of web applications.

Security: Reverse proxies can act as a barrier between the internet and the internal network of an organization, protecting against common security threats such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and filtering malicious traffic.

Caching: Reverse proxies can cache frequently accessed resources such as web pages and images, reducing the load on backend servers and improving the performance of web applications.

SSL/TLS encryption: Reverse proxies can terminate SSL/TLS connections from clients and establish new connections with backend servers, encrypting traffic between clients and servers and improving security.

Content delivery: Reverse proxies can be used to deliver content from multiple sources, such as different servers or CDNs, providing a unified interface for clients and improving performance.

Application firewall: Reverse proxies can filter and block malicious traffic, preventing attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

API gateway: Reverse proxies can act as a gateway for APIs, providing authentication, routing, rate limiting, and other features.

Geolocation: Reverse proxies can direct requests to different servers based on the geographic location of the client, providing localized content and improving performance.

Overall, reverse proxies are a powerful tool for improving the performance, security, and scalability of web applications. They provide a layer of abstraction between clients and servers, allowing administrators to manage and optimize traffic flow, filter and block malicious traffic, and distribute traffic across multiple servers.
