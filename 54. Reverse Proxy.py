# It is not possible to provide a complete python code for a reverse proxy as it requires a lot of infrastructure and configuration. However, here is a simple example of using the Python Flask framework to create a reverse proxy:
from flask import Flask
from werkzeug.middleware.proxy_fix import ProxyFix

app = Flask(__name__)
app.wsgi_app = ProxyFix(app.wsgi_app, x_for=1, x_host=1)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

# In this example, we are using the Flask framework to create a web application. We then use the ProxyFix middleware from the Werkzeug library to create a reverse proxy. The x_for=1 and x_host=1 arguments configure the middleware to use the X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Host headers, respectively, to forward requests to the backend server.

#The @app.route decorator defines a route for the web application, and the hello() function returns a simple greeting message.

#Note that this is just a simple example, and a real reverse proxy implementation would require much more configuration and infrastructure.
