# Load balancing is a complex task that typically requires specialized software or hardware solutions. Implementing a load balancer in Python would be beyond the scope of a simple code snippet, as it would require integrating with networking libraries, handling multiple concurrent connections, and implementing a sophisticated routing algorithm.

# However, here is a simple example of load balancing using Python's built-in http.server module:

import http.server
import socketserver

# Define the list of available servers
servers = ['localhost:8000', 'localhost:8001', 'localhost:8002']

# Define a custom handler that forwards requests to the selected server
class LoadBalancingHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        # Choose a server based on a round-robin algorithm
        server = servers.pop(0)
        servers.append(server)
        self.headers['Host'] = server

        # Forward the request to the selected server
        self.proxy_request()

    def proxy_request(self):
        # Open a connection to the selected server
        with socketserver.TCPServer(('localhost', 0), None) as proxy:
            # Forward the request to the selected server
            self.send_request(proxy)

            # Receive the response from the selected server
            self.receive_response(proxy)

    def send_request(self, proxy):
        # Send the request headers to the selected server
        self.log_request()
        proxy.request(self.command, self.path.encode(), headers=self.headers)

        # Send the request body to the selected server
        if self.headers.get('Content-Length'):
            body = self.rfile.read(int(self.headers['Content-Length']))
            proxy.wfile.write(body)

    def receive_response(self, proxy):
        # Receive the response headers from the selected server
        response = proxy.get_request()
        self.log_response(response.status, len(response.data))

        # Send the response headers back to the client
        self.send_response(response.status, response.reason)
        for key, value in response.headers.items():
            self.send_header(key, value)
        self.end_headers()

        # Send the response body back to the client
        self.wfile.write(response.data)

# Start the load balancer server
with socketserver.TCPServer(('localhost', 8080), LoadBalancingHandler) as server:
    server.serve_forever()

# This code defines a custom HTTP request handler that implements a round-robin load balancing algorithm across a list of available servers. When a client requests a resource from the load balancer server, the handler chooses the next server in the list and forwards the request to it. The selected server then processes the request and sends the response back to the load balancer, which in turn forwards it back to the client.
