A Load Balancer uses different strategies to distribute incoming traffic to different servers.
The common load balancing strategies are:

1. Round Robin Strategy
The requests are distributed in a circular fashion to all the servers.
If we have three servers A, B, and C, the requests are first sent to A, then B, and C, starting back at A.

2. Weighted Round Robin
Weights are assigned to different servers according to their capacity for handling requests.
The requests are distributed in a circular fashion to all these servers with respect to their weights.

3. Random Selection
The requests are distributed in a random fashion to all the servers.

4. Selection According To IP address
The IP address of a client is hashed to create a unique key that is used to redirect a request toward a particular server.

5. Selection According To Server Performance
According to this strategy, the requests can be redirected to the server with the least congestion / the fastest response time.
