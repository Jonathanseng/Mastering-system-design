# Here's an example Python implementation of Rendezvous Highest Random Weight (HRW) hashing:

import hashlib
import random

class HRWHash:
    def __init__(self, nodes):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.weights = {}

        # Assign random weights to each node
        for node in self.nodes:
            self.weights[node] = random.random()

    def get_node(self, key):
        max_node = None
        max_weight = None

        # Compute the HRW hash of the key for each node
        for node in self.nodes:
            h = hashlib.md5((str(key) + str(self.weights[node])).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
            if max_node is None or h > max_weight:
                max_node = node
                max_weight = h

        return max_node
# This implementation defines a HRWHash class that takes a list of nodes as input. It assigns a random weight to each node when the class is initialized. The get_node method is used to compute the HRW hash of a given key and return the node with the highest resulting hash value.

# To use the HRWHash class, you can create an instance with a list of node names or addresses:

nodes = ['node1', 'node2', 'node3']
hrw_hash = HRWHash(nodes)

# Then, you can use the get_node method to assign a key to a node:
  key = 'some_key'
node = hrw_hash.get_node(key)
# The node variable will contain the name or address of the node to which the key should be assigned, based on the HRW hash.
