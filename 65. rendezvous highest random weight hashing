Similar to Consistent hashing, it is a hashing strategy that minimizes the remapping of keys to values when a hash table is resized.
Following this strategy, a client weighs the available servers and sends requests to the one with the highest weight.
If this server is down, the client will send requests to the server with the next highest weight.
