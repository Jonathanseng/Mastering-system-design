# Implementing a Multi Master Replication Strategy in a distributed database system requires more than just a simple Python code snippet. It involves setting up a cluster of database nodes, configuring replication protocols, and implementing conflict detection and resolution mechanisms.

# However, to give you an idea of how Multi Master Replication can be implemented in Python, here is a simple example that demonstrates how to replicate data across two nodes:

import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import errorcode

# Connect to the primary node
primary_node = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="primary_node_host",
  user="username",
  password="password",
  database="database_name"
)

# Connect to the secondary node
secondary_node = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="secondary_node_host",
  user="username",
  password="password",
  database="database_name"
)

# Set up replication from primary to secondary node
try:
  primary_cursor = primary_node.cursor()
  primary_cursor.execute("SHOW MASTER STATUS")
  result = primary_cursor.fetchone()
  log_file, log_pos = result[0], result[1]

  secondary_cursor = secondary_node.cursor()
  secondary_cursor.execute(f"CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE='{log_file}', MASTER_LOG_POS={log_pos}")
  secondary_cursor.execute("START SLAVE")

except mysql.connector.Error as err:
  print("Error while setting up replication: {}".format(err))

# In this example, we are connecting to two MySQL database nodes - the primary node and the secondary node. We then use the SHOW MASTER STATUS command to obtain the current binary log file and position on the primary node. We use this information to set up replication from the primary node to the secondary node using the CHANGE MASTER and START SLAVE commands.

# Note that this is a simple example and does not include error handling, conflict detection, or resolution mechanisms, which are essential for implementing Multi Master Replication in production environments.
