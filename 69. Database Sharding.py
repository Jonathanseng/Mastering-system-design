# Database sharding typically involves setting up and configuring a distributed database system, which requires more than just writing Python code. However, there are Python libraries and frameworks that can help you work with sharded databases. Here's an example using the PyMongo library to interact with a MongoDB sharded cluster:

from pymongo import MongoClient

# Connect to the mongos router
client = MongoClient('mongodb://mongosrouter1.example.com:27017,mongosrouter2.example.com:27017,mongosrouter3.example.com:27017')

# Use a shard key to determine which shard to use
shard_key = {'user_id': 12345}

# Use the shard key to get a shard object
shard = client.get_shard(shard_key)

# Use the shard object to perform a query
collection = shard['mydb']['mycollection']
result = collection.find({'user_id': 12345})

# Print the result
for doc in result:
    print(doc)

    
    # This code connects to a MongoDB sharded cluster using the MongoClient class. It then uses a shard key to determine which shard to use for a query, and gets a shard object using the get_shard() method of the client object. Finally, it performs a query using the shard object and prints the results.

# Note that this is a simplified example, and that setting up and configuring a sharded database system requires more advanced knowledge and experience. It's important to carefully plan and test your sharding strategy to ensure that it meets your performance and scalability requirements.
