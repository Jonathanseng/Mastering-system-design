# Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific Python code for hotspot in system design as it is a concept rather than a specific implementation.

# However, I can provide an example of a Python code that can be used for monitoring system performance metrics, which is one of the steps in identifying hotspots in system design:
import psutil

# get system CPU usage
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent()

# get system memory usage
mem = psutil.virtual_memory()
mem_percent = mem.percent

# get system disk usage
disk = psutil.disk_usage('/')
disk_percent = disk.percent

# print system performance metrics
print('CPU usage:', cpu_percent, '%')
print('Memory usage:', mem_percent, '%')
print('Disk usage:', disk_percent, '%')

# This code uses the psutil module to get system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. By monitoring these metrics, system administrators can identify areas that are experiencing high levels of traffic or usage, which can help identify potential hotspots in the system.
