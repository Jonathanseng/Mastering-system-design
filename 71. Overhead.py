# Overhead in system design is a concept that is typically addressed at a higher level of abstraction than code. However, there are certain patterns and techniques that can be used in Python code to help manage overhead and improve the performance and scalability of a system. Here are a few examples:

# Caching: Python has several built-in caching libraries, such as functools.lru_cache and cachetools, which can be used to store frequently accessed data in memory. For example:
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# In this example, the fibonacci function is decorated with the lru_cache decorator, which stores the results of previous calls to the function in memory. This can improve the performance of the function by reducing the number of recursive calls that are required to compute the Fibonacci sequence.

# Parallel processing: Python has several built-in libraries, such as multiprocessing and concurrent.futures, which can be used to perform computations in parallel across multiple CPU cores. For example:

import concurrent.futures

def compute(data):
    # Perform some computation on the data
    return result

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = executor.map(compute, data)

# In this example, the compute function is called in parallel across multiple CPU cores using the ProcessPoolExecutor. This can improve the performance of the computation by utilizing the full processing power of the system.

# Distributed processing: Python has several libraries, such as Celery and Dask, which can be used to distribute computations across multiple nodes in a distributed system. For example:


import dask

def compute(data):
    # Perform some computation on the data
    return result

with dask.distributed.Client() as client:
    futures = client.map(compute, data)
    results = dask.distributed.wait(futures)


# In this example, the compute function is called in parallel across multiple nodes in a distributed system using the Dask library. This can improve the scalability of the computation by allowing it to be distributed across multiple machines.

# Overall, while Python code itself may not directly address the concept of overhead in system design, there are several patterns and techniques that can be used to manage overhead and improve the performance and scalability of a system.
