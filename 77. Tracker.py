# The implementation of a tracker in Python will depend on the specific application and context in which it is being used. However, here is a simple example of how you could use Python to track the number of times a button is clicked on a website:

import requests

# Define the URL of the button you want to track
button_url = "https://example.com/button"

# Send a request to the URL each time the button is clicked
def track_button_click():
    response = requests.get(button_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Button click tracked successfully!")
    else:
        print("Error tracking button click.")

# Call the track_button_click() function whenever the button is clicked
button.on_click(track_button_click)

# This code defines the URL of the button you want to track, and then sends a GET request to that URL each time the button is clicked. If the request is successful (i.e. the status code is 200), the code prints a success message. If the request fails, the code prints an error message.

# Note that this is a very simple example, and the specific implementation of a tracker will depend on the particular requirements of your application. Additionally, in many cases, you will need to use a more robust and scalable tool, such as Google Analytics or a dedicated tracking platform, to collect and analyze data.
