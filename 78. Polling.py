# Here's an example of how you can implement a simple polling mechanism in Python using a while loop and the time module:

import time

# Define a function that performs a task and returns a status
def perform_task():
    # Simulate a task that takes some time to complete
    time.sleep(1)
    return True

# Use polling to repeatedly check the status of a task
while True:
    status = perform_task()
    if status:
        print("Task completed successfully.")
        break
    else:
        print("Task not yet complete. Polling again in 5 seconds.")
        time.sleep(5)

        # In this example, the perform_task() function simulates a task that takes some time to complete (in this case, one second). The function returns True when the task is complete.

# The while loop uses polling to repeatedly check the status of the task by calling the perform_task() function. If the status is True, the loop prints a message indicating that the task has been completed and then exits the loop. If the status is not True, the loop prints a message indicating that the task is still in progress and waits for 5 seconds before polling again.

# Note that this is just a simple example of how polling can be implemented in Python, and there are many other ways to use polling depending on the specific application or context.
