Python provides several libraries for building streaming systems, including Apache Kafka and Apache Flink. Here is an example of using Apache Kafka to build a simple streaming system in Python:
from kafka import KafkaProducer
from kafka import KafkaConsumer

# set up the Kafka producer
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# send a message to the Kafka topic
producer.send('my_topic', b'Hello, world!')

# set up the Kafka consumer
consumer = KafkaConsumer('my_topic', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

# read messages from the Kafka topic
for message in consumer:
    print(message.value)

# This code sets up a Kafka producer that sends a message to a topic called "my_topic", and a Kafka consumer that reads messages from the same topic. The producer sends a byte string message, while the consumer reads the message and prints it to the console.

# Note that this is a very simple example and does not involve any real-time data processing or analysis. However, it demonstrates the basic concepts of using Kafka for streaming data in Python. To build more complex streaming systems, additional libraries and frameworks may be needed, such as Apache Flink for real-time data processing.
