# Implementing a full TCP protocol in Python would be quite complex, as it involves many different components such as the three-way handshake, data segmentation, flow control, error detection and correction, and more. However, here's a simple example of using the built-in socket library in Python to establish a TCP connection and send data:

import socket

# Create a TCP/IP socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Connect the socket to the server's IP address and port
server_address = ('localhost', 1234)
sock.connect(server_address)

# Send some data
message = b'Hello, server!'
sock.sendall(message)

# Receive response from the server
data = sock.recv(1024)
print('Received:', data)

# Close the socket
sock.close()


# In this example, we create a TCP/IP socket using the socket.socket() method, and then use the sock.connect() method to connect to a server at the specified IP address and port number. We then send some data using the sock.sendall() method and receive a response from the server using the sock.recv() method. Finally, we close the socket using the sock.close() method.

# Note that this is just a simple example of using TCP in Python, and a full implementation of the protocol would be much more complex.
