It is a process of controlling the rate of requests sent to and received by a system.
Rate limiting of incoming requests is done to prevent DoS attacks.
A popular rate limiting strategy is by tracking the IP addresses of clients.

how rate limiting throtting work?

Rate limiting and throttling are techniques used to limit the amount of traffic or requests that can be sent to a server or API. These techniques are often used to prevent abuse or overloading of the server, or to ensure fair usage of resources.

Rate limiting involves setting a maximum rate at which requests can be made. For example, an API may be rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per user. Once the limit is reached, additional requests are blocked or delayed.

Throttling, on the other hand, involves limiting the rate at which requests can be made. For example, an API may be throttled to a maximum of 10 requests per second. Requests that exceed this rate are delayed until the throttling limit is lifted.

Rate limiting and throttling can be implemented in various ways, such as:

Client-side limiting: Limiting the number of requests a client can make by using tokens, cookies, or IP addresses.

Server-side limiting: Limiting the number of requests allowed from a specific client or user account.

Time-based limiting: Limiting the number of requests per second, minute, or hour.

Dynamic limiting: Adjusting the rate limit based on server load or other factors.

In Python, there are libraries and frameworks that can help implement rate limiting and throttling, such as Flask-Limiter and Django Ratelimit. These libraries provide an easy-to-use interface to implement rate limiting and throttling in your web application.






Rate limiting throtting and its application

Rate limiting and throttling are important techniques for managing the flow of traffic to a server or API, and are widely used in web applications, APIs, and other network services. They are used to prevent overloading of servers, prevent abuse, ensure fair usage of resources, and improve overall system performance.

Some common applications of rate limiting and throttling include:

Web APIs: Many web APIs implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, such as unauthorized access, spam, or denial-of-service attacks. Rate limiting can also be used to ensure fair usage of resources, and to improve performance by preventing overloading of servers.

Online gaming: Rate limiting and throttling can be used to prevent cheating in online games by limiting the number of requests or actions that can be made per second or per minute.

Content delivery networks (CDNs): CDNs use rate limiting and throttling to prevent overloading of servers and to ensure fair usage of resources. They can also use dynamic limiting to adjust the rate limit based on server load or other factors.

Streaming services: Streaming services use rate limiting and throttling to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted streaming experience for users. They can also use dynamic limiting to adjust the rate limit based on network conditions or other factors.

Authentication and login systems: Rate limiting and throttling can be used to prevent brute-force attacks on authentication and login systems by limiting the number of login attempts per user or IP address.

In summary, rate limiting and throttling are important techniques for managing traffic to servers and APIs, and are used in a variety of applications to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage of resources, and improve system performance.
