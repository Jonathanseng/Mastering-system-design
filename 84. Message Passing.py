# Here's an example of message passing using Python's built-in multiprocessing module:

from multiprocessing import Process, Queue

# Define a function to be executed in a separate process
def worker(queue):
    # Wait for incoming messages and process them
    while True:
        message = queue.get()  # Block until a message is received
        if message == 'stop':
            break
        result = message ** 2  # Process the message data
        queue.put(result)  # Send the result back to the sender

# Create a message queue for communication
queue = Queue()

# Start a worker process to handle incoming messages
process = Process(target=worker, args=(queue,))
process.start()

# Send some messages to the worker process and receive the results
for i in range(5):
    queue.put(i)  # Send a message to the worker
    result = queue.get()  # Block until the result is received
    print(f'Result for {i}: {result}')

# Stop the worker process by sending a special message
queue.put('stop')
process.join()


# In this example, we define a function worker that runs in a separate process and waits for incoming messages on a message queue. The main process sends some messages to the worker by putting them on the message queue, and waits for the results by getting them from the same queue. The worker processes each message by computing its square and sending the result back to the sender.

# The multiprocessing module provides a simple way to implement message passing using processes and queues, which can be used to parallelize computation, distribute tasks across multiple machines, or build more complex distributed systems. Other messaging frameworks, such as RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, or Apache Kafka, provide additional features and scalability options for message passing, depending on the specific requirements of the system.
