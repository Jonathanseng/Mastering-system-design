It is a technique of passing instructions to invoke behavior on a system without directly contacting it.
Message passing can be:

1. Synchronous: Between objects running at the same time

2. Asynchronous: Between objects that may not be active/ready to execute commands at the same time when
an instruction is received Message passing can include:

3. Local objects: Where sender and receiver are on the same system

4. Distributed objects: Where sender and receiver are on different computers / run a different OS or programming language (for example, Remote procedure call)
