# how to implement the pubsub pattern in Python using the pubsub library:

from pubsub import pub

# Define a message listener
def my_listener(msg, data):
    print("Received a message on topic", msg.topic, "with data", data)

# Subscribe to a topic
pub.subscribe(my_listener, "mytopic")

# Publish a message to the topic
pub.sendMessage("mytopic", data="Hello, World!")


# In this example, we first import the pubsub library. We then define a message listener function my_listener that will be called whenever a message is received on the "mytopic" topic. The msg parameter will contain information about the message, such as the topic it was published to, and the data parameter will contain the message data.

# Next, we subscribe the my_listener function to the "mytopic" topic using the pub.subscribe() method.

#Finally, we publish a message to the "mytopic" topic using the pub.sendMessage() method. This will trigger the my_listener function to be called with the message data.

#Note that in a real-world application, you would likely have multiple publishers and subscribers, and would need to handle error conditions and message serialization/deserialization. However, this simple example should give you an idea of how the pubsub pattern can be implemented in Python using the pubsub library.
