It is an architectural pattern that consists of:

1. Publishers

2. Subscribers

3. Topics / Logical Channels 

4. Messages
Publishers create messages and broadcast them to different Topics.
Subscribers are linked to their Topics of interest and receive messages from them.

This is a method of message passing where services (publishers and subscribers) can asynchronously communicate with each other without ever achieving direct communication.
PubSub is usually a part of a larger message-oriented middleware system.
