# MapReduce is a programming model for distributed processing of large data sets, often used in conjunction with the Apache Hadoop project. There are several libraries available in Python for implementing MapReduce, including mrjob, which allows you to write MapReduce jobs that can be run on a Hadoop cluster. Here's an example of a basic MapReduce job using mrjob that counts the number of occurrences of each word in a text file:

from mrjob.job import MRJob
import re

WORD_RE = re.compile(r"[\w']+")  # regular expression for matching words

class MRWordCount(MRJob):
    
    def mapper(self, _, line):
        words = WORD_RE.findall(line)
        for word in words:
            yield (word.lower(), 1)
    
    def reducer(self, word, counts):
        yield (word, sum(counts))
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    MRWordCount.run()

    
# In this example, we're defining a MRWordCount class that inherits from MRJob, and defining two methods: mapper() and reducer(). The mapper() method splits the input data into words and yields key-value pairs of the form (word, 1), where word is a lowercase word from the input data, and 1 represents the count of occurrences of that word. The reducer() method sums the counts for each word and yields key-value pairs of the form (word, count).

# To run this MapReduce job using mrjob, you would save this code to a Python file (e.g. wordcount.py) and run the following command in your terminal:    
python wordcount.py input_file.txt > output_file.txt

# This would run the MapReduce job on the input file input_file.txt and save the output to the file output_file.txt. Note that mrjob handles the details of running the job on a Hadoop cluster, so you don't need to worry about setting up the cluster or writing low-level Hadoop code.
