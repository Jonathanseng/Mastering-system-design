A process on how TCP connection is established.
The steps can be easily understood by the example of a phone call.

1. SYN
A client sends SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) to the server. This is like calling a phone number and saying “Hello”.

2. SYN + ACK
The server acknowledges the connection request by sending an SYN-ACK signal back.
This is like saying “Hello” in return when you receive a call.

3. ACK
The client acknowledges (ACK) the response of the server

and sends an ACK signal to establish a reliable connection with the server.
This is like saying “This is Ashish. I would like to talk about...”
