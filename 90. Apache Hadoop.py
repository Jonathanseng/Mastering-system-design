# Apache Hadoop is a distributed computing framework that is typically accessed through APIs or command line tools rather than directly through Python code. However, there are Python libraries available that allow you to interact with Hadoop services and data stored in Hadoop clusters. Here's an example of how you might use the hdfs library in Python to interact with Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS):

# Import necessary libraries
from hdfs import InsecureClient

# Create a Hadoop client
client = InsecureClient('http://hadoop-master:50070', user='hdfs')

# List files in a directory
file_list = client.list('/my/directory')
print(file_list)

# Read a file from HDFS
with client.read('/my/file.txt') as reader:
    contents = reader.read()
    print(contents)

# Write a file to HDFS
with client.write('/my/new_file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as writer:
    writer.write('Hello, Hadoop!\n')

# In this example, we're creating a client object that connects to a Hadoop cluster's HDFS service, listing files in a directory, reading a file from HDFS, and writing a new file to HDFS.

# Note that this is just a basic example, and there are many more advanced techniques and features available for working with Hadoop data and services in Python.
