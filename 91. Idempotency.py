# The implementation of idempotency depends on the specific use case and the type of operation being performed. Here is an example Python code snippet that demonstrates the use of an idempotency key to ensure that a specific operation is only executed once:

import requests

def perform_operation_with_idempotency_key(idempotency_key):
    # Check if the operation has already been performed for this idempotency key
    if check_if_operation_already_performed(idempotency_key):
        # If the operation has already been performed, return the previous result
        return get_previous_result(idempotency_key)
    else:
        # If the operation has not been performed, perform it and store the result
        result = perform_operation()
        store_result(idempotency_key, result)
        return result

def check_if_operation_already_performed(idempotency_key):
    # Check if the operation has already been performed for this idempotency key
    # Returns True if the operation has already been performed, False otherwise
    # This could involve querying a database or cache to check if the result exists
    pass

def get_previous_result(idempotency_key):
    # Retrieve the result from the previous execution of the operation for this idempotency key
    # This could involve querying a database or cache to retrieve the previous result
    pass

def perform_operation():
    # Perform the operation that needs to be idempotent
    # This could involve making a request to an API or performing a database operation
    response = requests.get('https://example.com/api')
    return response.json()

def store_result(idempotency_key, result):
    # Store the result of the operation for this idempotency key
    # This could involve storing the result in a database or cache for future use
    pass

  # In this example, the perform_operation_with_idempotency_key function takes an idempotency_key as an argument and performs the operation only if it has not been performed before for that key. If the operation has already been performed for the key, the previous result is returned instead.

# The check_if_operation_already_performed function checks if the operation has already been performed for the given idempotency key, and the get_previous_result function retrieves the previous result if it exists.

# The perform_operation function is the actual operation that needs to be idempotent, and it returns a result that is stored for future use by the store_result function.

# Note that this is just an example implementation, and the actual implementation of idempotency will depend on the specific use case and the requirements of the system.
