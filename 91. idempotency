An operation is called Idempotent when it can be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the first time it was performed.
For example: If an operator sets the value of a variable called isCompleted to True , repeated operations wonâ€™t cause any
change in the value of this variable. Such an operation will be
called idempotent.
Idempotent operations are commonly used in messaging services to ensure that messages are delivered to consumers at least once.
