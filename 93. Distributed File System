Distributed File Systems allow storage and access to large datasets over multiple computers/ nodes (cluster of machines).
Each cluster can have:

1. a cluster manager node that manages the resources of the cluster

2. worker nodes that store and process data

Distributed File Systems ensure high availability of data using
redundancy with the addition of worker nodes as needed. Examples:
1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) !"Google File System (GFS)

2. GlusterFS

3. Quantcast File System (QFS)

How distributed file system work?

Distributed file systems work by allowing multiple computers to share and access files and data over a network. They are designed to provide a scalable and fault-tolerant way to store and retrieve data across a large number of nodes.

Here's a basic overview of how a distributed file system works:

File storage and metadata management: When a user or application wants to store a file, the distributed file system first decides where to store the file in the network. It uses a metadata management system to keep track of the location of files and their associated metadata (e.g., file name, file size, access permissions).

Data replication: To provide fault tolerance and ensure data availability, the distributed file system may replicate files across multiple nodes in the network. This means that if one node fails, another node can still provide access to the file.

Access and retrieval: When a user or application wants to access a file, the distributed file system retrieves the metadata for the file and uses it to locate the data across the network. The file system may use caching or load balancing techniques to optimize access times and minimize network congestion.

Consistency and synchronization: Distributed file systems must ensure that multiple users or applications accessing the same file at the same time do not overwrite each other's changes. They use consistency and synchronization protocols to ensure that changes made to a file are correctly propagated across the network.

Security and access control: Distributed file systems typically provide mechanisms for controlling access to files and ensuring the security of data. This may include authentication and authorization protocols, as well as encryption and data protection mechanisms.

Overall, distributed file systems provide a powerful way to store and access data across a network of computers. They are widely used in a variety of applications, from cloud computing and big data analytics to media streaming and high-performance computing.

Distributed file system and its application

A distributed file system is a type of file system that allows multiple users and applications to access and share data across a network of computers. Unlike traditional file systems that are limited to a single computer, distributed file systems are designed to work across a cluster of interconnected computers, each with its own storage capacity and processing power.

One of the primary benefits of a distributed file system is that it provides a scalable and reliable way to store and share data. By distributing data across multiple computers, a distributed file system can handle large amounts of data and provide fault tolerance, even if some nodes in the network fail.

Some popular examples of distributed file systems include:

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): This is an open-source distributed file system designed for storing and processing large data sets. It is commonly used in big data applications, such as data analytics and machine learning.

Google File System (GFS): This is a proprietary distributed file system used by Google for its storage needs. It is designed to handle large amounts of data across a cluster of commodity hardware.

GlusterFS: This is an open-source distributed file system that is designed to provide scalable and highly available storage for applications. It is commonly used in cloud computing environments.

Distributed file systems have many applications across different industries, including:

Data analytics: Distributed file systems can be used to store and process large amounts of data for data analytics applications. This can include things like log analysis, customer behavior analysis, and predictive modeling.

Media streaming: Distributed file systems can be used to store and distribute media files, such as video and audio files, for streaming services. This can include things like on-demand video streaming, live streaming, and podcasting.

Cloud computing: Distributed file systems can be used to provide scalable and highly available storage for cloud-based applications. This can include things like virtual machines, containers, and cloud-based databases.

High-performance computing: Distributed file systems can be used to provide high-performance storage for scientific and engineering applications, such as simulations and modeling. This can include things like weather modeling, computational fluid dynamics, and molecular dynamics.
