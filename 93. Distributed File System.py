# Python provides several libraries and frameworks for implementing distributed file systems, depending on the specific requirements and use cases. Here are a few examples of Python libraries that can be used to implement a distributed file system:

# Pyro4: Pyro4 is a distributed object framework for Python that allows objects to be shared and accessed across a network. It can be used to implement a distributed file system by defining a file server object that provides methods for storing, retrieving, and managing files.
# Here's an example of how to use Pyro4 to implement a simple distributed file system:

import Pyro4

@Pyro4.expose
class FileServer(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.files = {}

    def store_file(self, filename, data):
        self.files[filename] = data

    def retrieve_file(self, filename):
        return self.files.get(filename)

daemon = Pyro4.Daemon()
uri = daemon.register(FileServer)

print("URI:", uri)

daemon.requestLoop()

# In this example, we define a FileServer object that stores files in a dictionary. We use the @Pyro4.expose decorator to indicate which methods should be exposed to remote clients. We then create a Pyro4 daemon and register the FileServer object with it, which creates a URI that clients can use to access the object. Finally, we start the daemon's request loop to wait for client requests.

# PyDFS: PyDFS is a distributed file system library for Python that provides a simple interface for storing and retrieving files across a network. It can be used to implement a distributed file system with a master-slave architecture.
# Here's an example of how to use PyDFS to implement a simple distributed file system:

from pydfs import PyDFS

dfs = PyDFS()

dfs.master.add_slave('node1', 'localhost', 5000)
dfs.master.add_slave('node2', 'localhost', 5001)

dfs.store_file('/path/to/local/file', 'remote_filename')
data = dfs.retrieve_file('remote_filename')

print(data)


# In this example, we create a PyDFS object and add two slave nodes to it. We then store a local file in the distributed file system and retrieve it by its remote filename. PyDFS automatically handles the replication and synchronization of files across the network.

# Apache Thrift: Apache Thrift is a cross-language framework for implementing scalable and extensible services. It can be used to implement a distributed file system by defining a file service interface and implementing it in multiple languages, including Python.
# Here's an example of how to use Apache Thrift to implement a simple distributed file system:


from thrift.transport import TSocket, TTransport
from thrift.protocol import TBinaryProtocol
from file_service import FileService

transport = TSocket.TSocket('localhost', 9090)
transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)
protocol = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)
client = FileService.Client(protocol)

transport.open()
client.store_file('/path/to/local/file', 'remote_filename')
data = client.retrieve_file('remote_filename')
transport.close()

print(data)


# In this example, we use Apache Thrift to create a client that connects to a remote file service running on port 9090. We then store a local file in the distributed file system and retrieve it by its remote filename. The file service implementation can be written in any language supported by Apache Thrift, making it a highly flexible and scalable solution.
