Distributed File Systems allow storage and access to large datasets over multiple computers/ nodes (cluster of machines).
Each cluster can have:

1. a cluster manager node that manages the resources of the cluster

2. worker nodes that store and process data

Distributed File Systems ensure high availability of data using
redundancy with the addition of worker nodes as needed. Examples:
1. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) !"Google File System (GFS)

2. GlusterFS

3. Quantcast File System (QFS)
