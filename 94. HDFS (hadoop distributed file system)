Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) by Apache is a popular open-source distributed file system.
It is an open-source reimplementation of the Google File System (GFS).

HDFS consists of :

1. Central server (NameNode) that keeps a record of the file blocks stored on each machine

2. Worker machines (DataNode) running a networking daemon process that allows other nodes to access files stored on it
HDFS can be considered as a large file system that uses the space on the disks of multiple computers.
The file blocks of the system are replicated on multiple machines to ensure fault tolerance.
The data from this file system can be processed later (e.g. by using MapReduce in Apache Hadoop).

how hadoop distributed file system work:

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to store and manage large data sets in a distributed environment. Here's how HDFS works:

Data Blocks: HDFS breaks files into smaller blocks, typically 64 or 128 MB in size. Each block is stored across a set of data nodes in the Hadoop cluster.

Namenode: The Namenode is the master node that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients. It maintains metadata about the data blocks, such as their location and replication factor.

Datanodes: The datanodes are the worker nodes that store and manage the data blocks. They are responsible for reading and writing data blocks to the local file system and replicating them to other datanodes for fault tolerance.

Replication: To ensure data availability and fault tolerance, HDFS replicates each block to multiple datanodes in the cluster. The replication factor is configurable and typically set to three.

Data Access: Clients can access data stored in HDFS using various APIs, such as the Hadoop FileSystem API or Hadoop Streaming API. Clients can read or write files by communicating with the Namenode, which directs them to the appropriate datanodes.

Data Processing: HDFS is often used in conjunction with other Hadoop components, such as MapReduce or Apache Spark, to process and analyze large data sets. These systems read data from HDFS, perform computations, and write output back to HDFS.

In summary, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) breaks files into blocks and stores them across multiple datanodes in a Hadoop cluster. The Namenode maintains metadata about the data blocks and regulates access to the file system. HDFS provides fault tolerance and scalability, making it a popular choice for storing and managing large data sets in distributed environments.

hadoop distributed file system and its application

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to run on commodity hardware. It is one of the core components of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem and is used by many big data applications.

HDFS is designed to store large amounts of data in a fault-tolerant and scalable manner. It achieves this by splitting large files into smaller blocks and distributing them across multiple nodes in a cluster. Each block is replicated multiple times to ensure fault-tolerance in case of node failures.

Here are some of the applications of Hadoop Distributed File System:

Big Data Processing: HDFS is used to store and process large datasets in a distributed environment. Applications like Apache Spark, Apache Hive, and Apache Pig use HDFS as their underlying data store.

Log Processing: HDFS can be used to store and analyze log data generated by various applications. Applications like Apache Flume and Apache Log4j can be used to ingest log data into HDFS, and applications like Apache HBase can be used to analyze the data.

Machine Learning: HDFS can be used to store training data for machine learning models. Applications like Apache Mahout and Apache Spark MLlib can be used to train and deploy machine learning models using data stored in HDFS.

Image and Video Processing: HDFS can be used to store large image and video datasets. Applications like Apache Tika and Apache Flink can be used to process and analyze image and video data stored in HDFS.

Data Backup and Archival: HDFS can be used to store backups and archives of data. It provides data durability and fault-tolerance, making it a reliable choice for storing important data.

In summary, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a key component of the Hadoop ecosystem and is widely used in various big data applications. Its fault-tolerance, scalability, and data processing capabilities make it a popular choice for storing and processing large datasets.
