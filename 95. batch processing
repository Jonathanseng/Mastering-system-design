It involves the automated processing of a large amount of input data to produce the desired output by means of software programs called Batch jobs.
A Batch Job is executed with minimal to no human interaction as per a schedule and can take many minutes to several days to finish.
The primary performance of a batch processing system is measured by its throughput.
A batch processing system can be used for: 

1. Creating search indexes

2. Creating recommendation systems

3. Processing financial data (monthly payroll data), etc.

Examples:

1. MapReduce, is a popular batch processing algorithm implemented in various open source data systems at Google, Hadoop, CouchDB, and MongoDB.

2. Spring Batch is another open-source framework for batch processing.

how batch processing work?

Batch processing involves processing large volumes of data in batches or groups, typically using a batch processing system or framework such as Apache Hadoop or Apache Spark. Here's a high-level overview of how batch processing works:

Data ingestion: The first step in batch processing is to ingest the data into the batch processing system. This data may be in different formats, such as CSV, JSON, or XML, and may be stored in different locations, such as a database or a file system.

Data processing: Once the data has been ingested, it is processed using a batch processing framework. This framework typically divides the data into smaller batches or partitions, which can be processed in parallel across multiple nodes or servers. Each batch or partition is processed by a series of processing steps or jobs, which transform and analyze the data in various ways.

Data analysis: Once the processing is complete, the results are aggregated and analyzed to generate insights, such as identifying patterns or trends in the data, calculating statistical measures, or generating reports.

Output generation: The final step in batch processing is to generate the output, which may be in various formats such as reports, visualizations, or data files. The output may be stored in a database or file system, or may be sent to other systems or applications for further processing.

Overall, batch processing enables businesses to process and analyze large volumes of data efficiently, by breaking the data into smaller batches or partitions and processing them in parallel. This approach can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that are too big to be processed in real-time or near real-time.

batch processing and its application

Batch processing refers to the processing of large amounts of data in a batch or group, rather than in real-time or near real-time. Batch processing typically involves the execution of a sequence of processing steps or jobs that operate on the data, with the output of one job serving as the input to the next.

Batch processing has numerous applications across various industries, including:

Finance: Batch processing can be used for financial reporting and analysis, such as calculating financial statements, performing risk analysis, and generating reports for shareholders and regulators.

Marketing: Batch processing can be used to analyze customer data, such as demographics, purchase history, and web activity, to identify trends and patterns, and to create targeted marketing campaigns.

Manufacturing: Batch processing can be used to analyze production data, such as machine performance, production rates, and quality control, to identify areas for improvement and to optimize manufacturing processes.

Healthcare: Batch processing can be used to analyze patient data
