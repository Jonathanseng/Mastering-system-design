It involves the automated processing of a large amount of input data to produce the desired output by means of software programs called Batch jobs.
A Batch Job is executed with minimal to no human interaction as per a schedule and can take many minutes to several days to finish.
The primary performance of a batch processing system is measured by its throughput.
A batch processing system can be used for:

2. Creating recommendation systems

3. Processing financial data (monthly payroll data), etc.
