It involves the processing of data from a data stream to produce the desired output.
In comparison to Batch processing, Stream processing is performed in real-time on unbounded data streams rather than on a fixed-size input.

A stream processing system can be used for:

1. Building fraud detection systems

2. Log monitoring

3. Building Stock price data analytic tools, etc.
Amazon Kinesis is a popular stream processing service.
Apache Kafka Streams and Apache Spark are other open- source stream processing services.
