# To work with a multi-model database in Python, you first need to select a specific multi-model database that supports Python. There are several options available, including:

#ArangoDB (https://www.arangodb.com/)
#OrientDB (https://orientdb.com/)
#Couchbase Server (https://www.couchbase.com/)
#In this example, we'll use ArangoDB, which is a popular open-source multi-model database that supports Python.

#To get started, you'll need to install the ArangoDB Python driver using pip:
pip install pyArango

# Once you have installed the driver, you can connect to an ArangoDB database using the following code:


from pyArango.connection import *
 
conn = Connection(
  arangoURL="http://localhost:8529",
  username="root",
  password="password",
  verify=True,
  httpSync=True,
)
 
db = conn["myDatabase"]

# This code establishes a connection to an ArangoDB database running on the local machine, using the root username and password. Replace the URL, username, and password with the values for your own ArangoDB database.

# Once you have connected to the database, you can perform operations using the various data models supported by ArangoDB. For example, to insert a document into a collection, you can use the following code:
from pyArango.collection import Collection, Field
 
class MyCollection(Collection):
  _fields = {
    "name": Field()
  }
 
myCollection = db.createCollection("myCollection", className="MyCollection")
 
myDocument = myCollection.createDocument()
myDocument["name"] = "John Doe"
myDocument.save()

# This code defines a new collection called "myCollection" with a single field called "name". It then creates a new document in the collection with the name "John Doe".

# You can also perform graph operations in ArangoDB using the Python driver. For example, to create a new vertex in a graph, you can use the following code:

from pyArango.graph import Graph, EdgeDefinition
 
class MyGraph(Graph):
  _edgeDefinitions = [EdgeDefinition("myEdgeCollection", fromCollections=["myVertexCollection"], toCollections=["myVertexCollection"])]
 
myGraph = db.createGraph("myGraph", className="MyGraph")
 
myVertexCollection = myGraph.createVertexCollection("myVertexCollection")
 
myVertex = myVertexCollection.createVertex()
myVertex.save()

# This code defines a new graph called "myGraph" with a single vertex collection called "myVertexCollection". It then creates a new vertex in the collection.

#Overall, working with a multi-model database in Python involves selecting a database that supports Python, installing the necessary driver or library, establishing a connection to the database, and then using the appropriate APIs or libraries to perform operations on the data using the different data models supported by the database.
