# Cache hits are not something that can be directly coded in Python as they are a performance metric that arises when using a cache memory. However, here's an example of how caching can be implemented in Python using a simple dictionary:
cache = {}

def expensive_function(argument):
    if argument in cache:
        # If the result is in the cache, a cache hit occurs
        print("Cache hit!")
        return cache[argument]
    else:
        # If the result is not in the cache, compute it and store it in the cache
        result = perform_expensive_computation(argument)
        cache[argument] = result
        return result

# In this example, expensive_function is a function that performs some expensive computation, and cache is a dictionary that acts as a cache memory. When expensive_function is called with an argument, it first checks if the result for that argument is already stored in the cache by looking up the argument in the cache dictionary. If the result is found in the cache, a cache hit occurs, and the function returns the result directly from the cache. Otherwise, the expensive computation is performed, the result is stored in the cache, and the result is returned.

# By using a cache like this, the expensive computation only needs to be performed once for each unique input, and subsequent calls to the function with the same input can be served directly from the cache, avoiding the need to perform the computation again. When a cache hit occurs, the system can retrieve the data quickly from the cache memory, improving performance and reducing latency.
